# Scala-collections
Scala is a general-purpose, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language that runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). The files in this repositories(those with .scala file extension) are practice examples to creating scala collections (Array buffer, Lists, Sequence, Sets $ Maps) for a program that allows users to key in student details and student marks then carry out operations on them with variations of the different collections then outputs meaningful information.
# Getting Started
Install scala environment using the scala documentation online www.scala-lang.org/download/ 
# Implementing the programs
Open your scala console(linux) / Command Prompt/Windows PowerShell(windows)
after shifting to the directory your saving your work, (in my case **cd Desktop**) compile the files using the commands
```bash
scala> scalac ArrayBuffer.scala
scala> scalac List.scala
scala> scalac Map.scala
scala> scalac Sequence.scala
scala> scalac Set.scala
```
# Running the program
After compiling, run the programs using the commands
```bash
scala> scala ArrayBuffer.scala
scala> scala List.scala
scala> scala Map.scala
scala> scala Sequence.scala
scala> scala Set.scala
```
